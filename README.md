Training_Agent_For_Go_Game

1. Overview
In this programming assignment, you will develop your own AI agents based on some of the AI
techniques for Search, Game Playing, and Reinforcement Learning that you have learnt in class to play a
small version of the Go game, called Go-5x5 or Little-Go, that has a reduced board size of 5x5. Your agent
will play this Little-Go game against some basic as well as more advanced AI agents. Your agents will be
graded based on their performance in these online game “tournaments” on Vocareum.com. Your
objective is to develop and train your AI agents to play this Little-Go game as best as possible.
